# Mangasee Database Manager

A tool to download and update a seperate Mangasee (or Manga4life) database.

It allows other tools to interface with mangasee while offline.

To run it with a Node 17+ you have to use volta with that version while NVM is set to something supported by sqlite3. Don't know why it works but it does, or just turn off volta, that seems to work.
